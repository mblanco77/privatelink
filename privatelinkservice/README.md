# Private link service scenario

This scenario is intended to demonstrate a connection between a private link service (provider) and a private link endpoint (consumer) where the provider wants to expose privately a service behind a standard load balancer and can be consumed by multiple clients using a private ip on the client address space.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmblanco77%2Fprivatelink%2Fmaster%2Fprivatelinkservice%2Fazuredeploy.json)

this scenario is deployed using arm templates by executing deploy.ps1
### [deploy.ps1](deploy.ps1)
inputs for deploy.ps1:

```yaml
$resourceGroupName : azure resource group name (new or existing)
$location: azure region where de deployment should run
$vmUser : Username for the virtual machines
$vmPass : password assigned to virtual machines
```

output:

```yaml
OutputsString           :
                          Name             Type                       Value
                          ===============  =========================  ==========
                          vmuser           String                     azureuser 
                          vmpass           String                     P1xxxxxxxx
                          vmconsumerurl    String                     vmconsumerxxx.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

## How to test the scenario

RDP into the consumer virtual machine (vmconsumerurl)

1. first notice that the machine doesnâ€™t have internet access, you can ping an external site, or try to navigate to some web page

2. consume via browser the service exposed in http://10.5.0.4 which is mapped to private ip of the standard load balancer of the provider.

## Notes:

*This can be enabled in different tenant and subscriptions

*This Enables also an scenario where the provider and the consumer have overlapping addresses where private peering cannot be used
